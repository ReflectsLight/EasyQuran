** Add ~SurahRedirect~ component
The ~SurahRedirect~ component redirects from the root path
to a specific locale (eg ~/en/~). The redirect is based on
browser preferences, and will fall back onto the English
locale when there are no matches

** Embed The Noble Quran within 'Quran' package
The Noble Quran, and an English + Farsi translation have been
embedded into the 'Quran' package (see ~packages/typescript/Quran/~).
This change makes the 'Quran' package more useful and capable
than its previous implementation

** Add ~Surah.prototype.ayat~
The ~Surah.prototype.ayat~ getter returns the contents
of a surah as an array of Ayah objects. The array is
populated automatically, and on-demand

** Add ~Quran.durations~
The ~Quran.durations~ getter returns an array where
each element represents the durations of a surah -
ayah by ayah

** Add ~Quran.surahs~
The ~Quran.surahs~ getter returns an object where the
key is the locale name, and the value is an array of
Surah objects

** Replace ~play|pause~ icons
Replace the play and pause icons

** Remove nanoc-gzip.rb
Unneccessary for a packaged KaiOS application

** Remove loaders
Remove all loaders from ~/src/js/loaders/~, and the postman
package (~packages/typescript/postman~)

** Replace multiple entry points with a single entry point
The ~/src/js/main/*~ directory - which previously contained
multiple entry points - has been reduced to a single entry
point: ~/src/js/index.tsx~

** Redesign as a Single Page Application (SPA)
The previous approach where we generated a HTML file
for every surah in each language has been replaced by
a Single Page Application (SPA) that is more suitable
for KaiOS.
